            I finally reached where I wanted always wanted to. And that gives me relief. 
            <br>The question is where did I exactly want to come to? Was it in the vicinity of this city.
            <br>(You do remember the road in the first entry, don't you?)
            <br>In this city, I've heard a million people live. They live with their dreams
            <br>They live with their work and their little life centered around themselves and their families.
            <br>And now it is to me to find a more beautiful destiny than theirs.

        </p>
        <p id="second">
            <br>The Metropolis is just the way it was. I have riches to my aid now, I live and dine amongst the elites of the city.
            <br>The world only smaller and humble to me. But... <br>
            <br>Ironically enough, now that I have spent a few years in the city, I yearn to go back to the forest.
            <br>To not continue living the way I have but to try again, and get the feeling again,
            <br><strong><em>The feeling of excitment of trying and of being uncertain</em></strong>
            <br>But that I believe shall be too strenous to carry forth.
            <br><br>

        <p id="last">
            Well, well. I am glad you showed again. I just wanted to let you know, I did try again. This time to bring about a change in the city.
            <br>I no longer am a part of the city that got assimilated in it. 
            <br>The city has assimilated me and I have assimilated it. 
            <br>We are mutual beneficiaries. And I understood something...
            <br><strong><em>
                The world looks great only when I changed something in it's working. Not just lived to the expectations I was bound to.
                <br>Not being able to change the world does not make me sad, and it did not in at least those hundred attempts that failed.
                <br>But I could just not rest without changing it. That was the problem. And hence, I kept trying. 
                <br>I changed the world in my own way - I changed my world, in my own way.
            </em></strong>

      Well, well. The world is not just something we are a part of.
      <br>It is also a part of ours. And so, our choices greatly bring upveal to its functioning.
