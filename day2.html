        Can you feel the breeze of the second page? <!--Ha ha here-->
        <br>
        We all love the first day, don't we? - It feels so fresh<br>
        It feels enthralling, one can even feel goosebumps and shivers every now and then.
        It is all so very beautiful and you curse yourself for being a sissy for sitting silent in a corner
        <br>Or maybe you just make it your best day - get a bunch of new friends in school or college
        <br>Or maybe just feel good by the smell of the page when reading a book.
        <br>Whatever you do, you always remember your first day.
      </p>

          <br>
          <br>What about the second day, the third day or so forth?
          <br>When you still have those stomach cramps but the thrill is reduced.
          <br>You still have a feel in you, but you no longer feel bothered by it.
          <br>How do you celebrate you second day? Or the third day?
          <br>Or the days that carry the description I just laid forth?
          <br><br>

          Do you know what is more important than anything else?
          <br> Celebration...
          <br>When a student gets rid of his/her examination, it is time for a celebration.
          <br>You passed another day, does that not demand a celebration?
          <br>Now, now...life is not an exam. I repeat, it is not an exam.
          <br> It is a blank canvas that was left to you to write upon.
          <br>The availability of paint is though subject to those things in your life, you couldn't control.

          <button id="but3" onclick="next3()">Next</button>

      <p id="last">
          How about a small celebration now itself?
          <br> You just completed this second page of this boring web-blog.
          <br>Play your favourite music and lay back to rest.
          <br>Trust me, you deserve one for being a good reader, one I could never become. XD
          <br>And remember, this last verse from day 1 - 
          <br>
          <strong>
          You did it!
          <br>
          You did well
          <br>
          Fear not any longer
          <br>
          What you did was your best back then...
