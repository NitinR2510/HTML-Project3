            <br>I narrated a very broken story as one would proceed through the four pages.
            <br>I just had this idea and so, I believed that it was a one worth trying. 
            <br>However, from my side, I would just like to add that what went past was just a story.
            <br>It is just the random philosophy of a random guy out there somewhere trying to make stuff work in his way.
            <br>We all are bound to live our lives as subject to stuff like calamities, circumstances and furthermore...
            <br><strong>CONSEQUENCES...</strong>
        </p>
        <p id="second">
          <br>Ok. I ought to be no one to comment on stuff like that. 
          <br>I am myself a resident of a country where people and my neighbours are more keen on creating war-like situations
          <br>than fighting a war that is already home. And if any person reads this say in 2022 or so, by which I believe that 
          <br>the war would be over, I speak of the COVID-19 which I sincerely pray that would have had gone by that time.
          <br>People, all I wished to say through this blog is that we are stronger, trust me, we are than a burning sensation
          <br>of letting go this pain through ones greater and are often described as illnesses in psychological meet-ups.
          <br>And for god's sake and for our own sake, at least remember - our actions - positive and negative ring throughout eternity.
          <br>

        <p id="last">
           <br>That, darling is <strong>Physics</strong>. Some might just be cursing me at this point, saying that all this for the sake of 
           <br>f***ing stupid physics!!! Buddy, there are things we ought to know. And one thing I've known is that if I understand  
           <br>the cause of something, let's say why I love football, I often try to down play that urge to watch a match. The same
           <br>for cricket and so forth. One thing we must understand is that this bloody mind of ours is pretty special.
           <br>It's a f***ing miracle, people! You know what, you don't necessarily have to be a yogi or a prophet or Jesus to know it.
           <br> You just need to be <strong><em>Yourself...</em></strong>
